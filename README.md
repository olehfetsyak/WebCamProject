WebCamProject

This is a personal project I have been working on with a goal of recreating motion capture cameras. 
My final goal is to setup an arduino to feed live data to the script,
have the script process the data, 
create a picture with a mask of the outline of the movement occuring,
and send the image to an database to keep track of the cars that passed by.
